## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]


The process of creating an iOS app doesn't stop with the creation of functional code. At some point you will need to verify that the code you have written actually satisfies all of your project's requirements. When developing for iOS and Swift, how will you accomplish this task?  

With Xcode 6 it is actually quite easy: enter XCTest. XCTest is a built-in testing framework that will allow you to quickly and easily write unit tests in order to verify your code. This course will walk you through the process of writing basic tests using XCTest.
